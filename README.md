"DESCRIPTION": Objectives

1. Architecture Diagram & Documentation

Create a visual architecture using AWS and Azure (or GCP), highlighting how front‑end, back‑end, data, authentication, and networking components interact.

Provide written explanations covering service responsibilities, traffic flows, failover logic, security controls, and cost/governance considerations.



2. Hybrid Deployment and Distribution

Host core compute workloads on AWS (e.g., EC2 or ECS), and deploy analytics or machine‑learning workloads on Azure (e.g., Databricks or Azure Functions).

Implement cross‑cloud networking (e.g., VPN/Gateway or VPC Peering) and DNS load balancing for workload distribution and cross‑region failover.



3. Resilience & Failover Strategy

Architect active-active or cold-standby failover: if AWS becomes unavailable, traffic seamlessly shifts to Azure deployment.

Provision database replicas or backups (e.g., Azure SQL from AWS‑hosted app), or use distributed storage to ensure continuity  .



4. Security & Identity Management

Use unified IAM, e.g., Azure AD or cloud-agnostic identity broker, to centralize authentication across provider environments  .

Encrypt data in-transit and at-rest, implement WAF/NSG/firewalls per cloud environment, and maintain consistent logging and auditing.



5. Governance, Monitoring & Cost Control

Use centralized policies across clouds (e.g., IaC using Terraform, policy-as-code, tagging, budget alerts)  .

Integrate cost and performance dashboards across providers for real-time visibility and optimization.



6. Demo & Proof of Concept

Deploy a sample microservices application where:

The front-end UI and API run on AWS.

The analytics engine runs on Azure.


Use Azure Databricks to process data stored in AWS S3, showcasing cross-cloud data handling  .

Simulate AWS failure in the demo to trigger failover to Azure-hosted services.



7. Documentation & GitHub Deliverables

Architecture Diagram: visual representation with annotations.

ReadMe: clear descriptions of each component, deployment scripts, instructions.

Demo Walk-through: code, IaC modules, deployment scripts, failover demonstration notes.
